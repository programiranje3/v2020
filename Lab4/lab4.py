# Task 1
# Write a function that receives an arbitrary number of numeric values
# and computes their product. The function also receives a named argument
# "absolute" with the default value False, which determines if the numeric
# values should be used as given or their absolute value should be used instead.
#
# Implement the function in two different ways:
# 1) using a for loop
# 2) using the reduce() f. from the functools module together with an appropriate lambda f.
#   for an example and explanation of reduce() f. check, for example, this article
#   https://realpython.com/python-reduce-function/ or this one:
#   https://www.python-course.eu/python3_lambda.php




# Task 2
# Write a function that receives an arbitrary number of strings and returns a list
# of those strings where the first and the last character are the same (case-insensitive)
# and the total number of unique characters is above the given threshold. The threshold
# is given as a named argument with the default value of 3.
#
# Implement the function in three different ways:
# 1) using the for loop
# 2) using list comprehension
# 3) using the filter() f. together with an appropriate lambda f.




# Task 3
# Write a function that receives a list of product orders, where each order is a 4-tuple
# of the form (order_id, product_name, quantity, price_per_item). The function returns
# a list of 2-tuples of the form (order_id, total_price) where total price (in USD) for
# an order is the product of the quantity and the price per item (in USD).
# The function also receives two named arguments that may affect the computed total price:
# - discount - the discount, expressed in percentages, to be applied to the total price;
#   the default value of this argument is 0 (UPDATE)
# - shipping - the shipping cost to be added to orders with total price less than 100 USD.
#   default value of this argument is 10 (USD).
#
# Implement the function in three different ways:
# 1) using the for loop
# 2) using list comprehension
# 3) using the map() f. together with an appropriate lambda f.




# Task 4
# Create a decorator that measures the time a function takes to execute
# and prints the duration to the console.
#
# Hint 1: use the decorator-writing pattern:
# import functools
# def decorator(func):
#     @functools.wraps(func)			                # preserves func's identity after it's decorated
#     def wrapper_decorator(*args, **kwargs):
#         # Do something before
#         value = func(*args, **kwargs)
#         # Do something after
#         return value
#     return wrapper_decorator
#
# Hint 2: to measure the time of function execution, use the perf_counter() f.
# from the time module (it returns a float value representing time in seconds).




# Task 4.1
# Write a function that for each number x in the range 1..n (n is the input parameter)
# computes the sum: S(x) = 1 + 2 + ... + x-1 + x, and returns the sum of all S(x).
# Decorate the function with the timer decorator.
#
# Write the function in a few different ways - e.g. (1) using a loop; (2) using list comprehension;
# (3) using the map f. - and decorate each one with the timer to compare their performance




# Task 4.2
# Write a function that creates a list by generating n random numbers (integers)
# between 1 and k (n and k are input parameters). After generating and adding each
# number to the list, the function computes and prints the difference
# between mean and median of the list elements. Decorate the function with
# the timer decorator.
#
# Bonus: assure that each function invocation produces the same results




# Task 5
# Create a decorator that standardizes (= z-transforms) a list of numbers
# before passing the list to a function for further computations.
# The decorator also rounds the computation result to 4
# digits before returning it (as its return value).
#
# Bonus: before calling the wrapped function, print, to the console,
# its name with the list of input parameters (after standardisation)




# Task 5.1
# Write a function that receives an arbitrary number of int values
# and for each value (x) computes the following sum:
# S(x) = 1 + x + x**2 + x**3 + ... + x**n
# where n is the keyword argument with default value 10.
# The function returns the sum of S(x) of all received int values.
# Decorate the function with the standardise decorator.
